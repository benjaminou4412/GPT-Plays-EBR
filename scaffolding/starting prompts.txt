I'd like you to try playing the board game Earthborne Rangers. I've provided a good amount of documentation or scaffolding that should help you play the game in a purely text-based format, and like anybody new to a game, we should take some time to read through it before we start playing. Go ahead and read through the EBR_rulebook_web.pdf I've provided you, as well as the plaintext summaries/references I provided in the two .txt files. Thoroughly digest the rules of the game; card games like this are all about attention to detail and knowing the rules front and back. We'll start playing once you've shown you have a good understanding of the overall rules.

We'll skip the prologue. Go right ahead and use the json files I've provided to build yourself a deck. You'll have to pick one of four backgrounds (artisan, traveler, forager, or shepherd), and one of four specialties (artificer, explorer, conciliator, or shaper). Feel free to browse the 8 json files corresponding to those card sets to inform your decision, as well as personality_cards.json for the personality cards you're required to add to your deck.
