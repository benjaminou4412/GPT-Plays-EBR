General rules:

	If rules text contains an unrecognized symbol, just drop in "[symbol]" as a placeholder.

	Alert the user to any ambiguities not specified by the guide/template/schema.

	In general, try to copy text exactly. Don't infer or guess.


Field-by-field extraction guide (from the card image)

title

	Location: large text at the very top.

	Copy exactly. Don’t infer or translate.

card_type and traits

	Location: the small line under the title. It looks like Being / Predator / Mammal or Feature / Flora / Structure.

	Parsing: split on /. Trim spaces. The first token is card_type. Everything after that, in order, goes into traits.

presence

	Location: purple square at top-right.

	Write the integer shown, or the literal "X" when printed as X.

harm_threshold and progress_threshold

	Location: the paired squares near the bottom-right of the art/rules area. Red on the left (harm), blue on the right (progress).

	Copy each number exactly; use "X" if the square shows X. If the square shows a number followed by a letter, like "2R", record it exactly.

	One or both thresholds may be missing. In this case, record as "-1".

	One or both thresholds may show a diagonal slash. In this case, record as "-2".

	One or both thresholds may show a special symbol not covered by the above cases; it resembles a diamond. In this case, record as "Ranger Token".

enters_play

	Location: tiny triangle under the set icon at top-left.

	Upwards triangle (point facing up) → "along_the_way".

	Inverted triangle (point facing down) → "within_reach".

enters_play_with

	Location: small box immediately under the presence diamond. Looks like 1 bees, etc.

	If present: type is the lowercase resource name exactly as printed (e.g., "bees"), and amount is its integer (e.g., 1).

	If absent: set type to null and amount to 0.

rules (list, in printed order)
Identify each distinct text block/banner in the beige text area from top to bottom. For each, create an object:

	kind

		"static": ordinary rule lines with no challenge icon band. Includes lines prefixed with words like Refresh: or explanatory sentences like “X is equal to…”.

		"test": a rules line that describes a test/cost sequence rather than a challenge banner. Often shows aspect abbreviations like AWA + : before the colon; still no challenge icon.

		"challenge": appears on a colored banner with an icon at the left. This is always one of the three challenge symbols below.

	challenge_symbol

		For "challenge" rules, map the icon/color to:

			"sun" = yellow circular/sun symbol (often used for “ready/energize”-type effects).

			"mountain" = blue mountain/peak icon.

			"crest" = red crest/shield icon.

		For "static" and "test", set to null.

	text

		Copy the printed sentence(s) for that line/banner.

		Keep formatting tokens: → (arrow), numbers, “X”, labels like “Refresh:”, and game terms (“exhaust”, “ready”, “suffer 1 injury”, “presence”).

		If the line references tokens, name them exactly as the card does (e.g., “harm token”, “progress token”).

		Don’t invent keywords beyond what’s printed.

Quality checks an LLM should perform

	If kind is "challenge", challenge_symbol must be one of sun|mountain|crest. Otherwise it must be null.

	If enters_play_with.type is null, amount must be 0.

	Use "X" (uppercase string) exactly where the card prints X; don’t convert X to numbers.

	Preserve the original order of rules as printed.
